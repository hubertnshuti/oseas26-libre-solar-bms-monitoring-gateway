# Open Remote Monitoring Gateway for Libre Solar BMS

An open, deployable remote monitoring gateway that reads live data from the Libre
Solar BMS, publishes it to a standard MQTT layer, and makes it visible in the
tools operators and the community already use.

## Abstract and goal

The Libre Solar BMS is a capable open-source battery management system, but once
deployed in the field it is effectively a black box. Operators have no
straightforward, open way to see what a pack is doing — state of charge, cell
balance, temperature, fault history — or to adjust its configuration without
physically visiting the site. This pushes operators toward proprietary monitoring
hardware and recurring cloud subscriptions, or leaves them flying blind. Across
Sub-Saharan Africa, where site visits are costly and connectivity varies widely,
early detection of a failing cell, an over-temperature event, or an undersized
system can be the difference between a quick fix and a dead battery bank.

The goal is an open, deployable remote monitoring gateway that reads live data
from the Libre Solar BMS, publishes it to a standard MQTT layer, and makes it
visible in the tools operators and the community already use.

A crucial design point drives the whole architecture: the three consumer
platforms are different in kind, and the data must be shaped for each.

- **MicroPowerManager (MPM)** is a customer-and-asset management platform
  (Laravel + MySQL) — essentially a CRM/ERP for decentralised utilities. It is
  *not* a
  timeseries database and must not be treated as one. MPM should receive
  low-frequency, decision-relevant battery state as asset metadata and events,
  shown in the battery's asset view — the numbers an operator acts on, not a
  high-resolution trace.
- **Home Assistant and Prospect (A2EI)** are open-source, self-hostable
  monitoring platforms built to handle timeseries telemetry. They are the right
  home for live/historical curves and dashboards. Both are read-only consumers;
  neither controls the battery.

Because all three read from the same MQTT feed, the real deliverable is a clean,
documented MQTT topic + JSON schema. Get that right and each platform is just a
subscriber; MPM takes a downsampled/event slice, while Home Assistant and
Prospect take the full stream.

## Expected outcomes

A new repository being created and populated to provide:

- **BMS simulator (first step):** a script that publishes representative BMS JSON
  to MQTT against the agreed schema. This unblocks all software work and is the
  reference for the data contract.
- **Documented MQTT schema:** topic structure and JSON payloads, including Home
  Assistant auto-discovery, as the project's source of truth.
- **MPM integration:** an ingestion path that writes the low-frequency metrics
  into MPM, and a battery-health view in the asset UI (SoC, SoH/cycles,
  imbalance, max temperature, fault log, last-seen).
- **Home Assistant integration:** entities appearing automatically via MQTT
  auto-discovery.
- **One real transport path proven end-to-end:** either A1 (BMS publishes MQTT
  over WiFi) or A2 (BMS → UART → Cicada → cellular → broker), demonstrated
  against the shared real BMS — with the simulator as fallback.
- **Documentation:** setup and reproduction steps so the result is a
  field-deployable monitoring kit (target users: SLS Energy and other Libre Solar
  deployments).

## Required knowledge

### Stack

- **BMS simulator (first step):** a small script that publishes representative BMS
  data (JSON) to MQTT, standing in for real hardware. This is built and used
  before any board is touched.
- **BMS firmware:** Zephyr RTOS on the Libre Solar BMS (ESP32-C3 target) — the
  source of the battery data and the target of any (stretch) configuration
  commands.
- **Transport layer:** either MQTT-over-WiFi published directly from the BMS, or a
  UART stream relayed by an EnAccess Cicada 4G module (Mbed OS / STM32, SIM7600
  modem) over cellular.
- **Message broker:** an MQTT broker (Mosquitto) as the single hub; a documented
  topic + JSON schema is the project's source of truth.
- **Backend / integration:** a service that consumes MQTT and writes battery state
  into MPM, plus adapters that let Home Assistant and Prospect consume the same
  feed.
- **Frontend:** a battery-health view inside MPM's existing asset UI. (Home
  Assistant and Prospect generate their own dashboards from the feed — no custom
  frontend needed there.)

### Programming languages

- **Python or JavaScript / TypeScript** — the simulator, the backend ingestion
  service, and the platform adapters. This is the bulk of the core work and needs
  no embedded skills.
- **C / Zephyr** — BMS firmware: WiFi + MQTT client (path A1) or a framed UART
  export (path A2), plus the optional config handler.
- **PHP / Laravel 11 + Vue.js 2** — MPM's own stack, for the battery-health asset
  view and the ingestion endpoint on the MPM side (MySQL 8, PHP 8, Node 18).
- **C / Mbed OS** — Cicada relay firmware (path A2 only). Not code-compatible with
  the BMS Zephyr stack; the two communicate only over the defined UART contract.

### Helpful experiences

- MQTT: brokers, topic design, and Home Assistant's MQTT auto-discovery
  convention.
- Backend/API integration in Python or TypeScript.
- Docker (running Mosquitto, Home Assistant, MPM, and Prospect locally).
- Embedded C / an RTOS — for the firmware paths only (Zephyr especially; Mbed OS
  for the relay).
- Serial / UART protocol design (framing, checksums) — path A2 only.
- Basic battery/BMS literacy — enough to know what the telemetry means (mentoring
  available from the case giver).
